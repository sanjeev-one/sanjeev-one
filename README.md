# Hi there, I'm [Your Name]! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about technology, coding, and collaborating on innovative projects. Here's a little bit about what I do:

## ðŸ§ª SLAC National Lab Code

I have had the opportunity to contribute to projects at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### Project 1: Modeling and optimization of the FACET-II injector with machine learning algorithms
**Description**: Published at IPAC'24 - This project focuses on enhancing the SLAC FACET-II injector's performance by integrating machine learning algorithms. Traditional physics simulations are computationally demanding, and our approach replaces these intensive computations with a machine learning model that predicts outcomes in milliseconds. This innovation enables real-time physics predictions, significantly improving operational efficiency. The core of our model is a simple feedforward neural network that predicts key parameters like beam emittance and bunch length based on various inputs. A gradient descent feature analysis of the models reveals which input parameters impact which output parameters signifcantly, aiding the development of virtual diagnostics for particle accelerators.

**Tech Stack**: Python, MATLAB, XOPT, GPT (General Particle Tracer), Lucretia, openPMD, CNSGA (Controlled Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm), Feedforward Neural Network.

### Project 2: Bmad L1 and L2 phase scan
**Description**: This project simulates beam dynamics in the FACET-II particle accelerator. It performs a double for-loop scan over L1 and L2 phases to analyze their impact on beam behavior, setting up the simulation environment, running simulations, and visualizing results in a matrix plot format.

**Tech Stack**: Python, Anaconda, Bmad, pytao, openpmd-beamphysics, numpy, matplotlib, pandas
